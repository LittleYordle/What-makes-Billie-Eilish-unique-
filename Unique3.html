<br><big>This work is dedicated to the artist Billie Eilish. The following pages contain information about what distinguishes this performer from others, why and how over the past few years she has gained such popularity that she serves as sources of inspiration and personal information.</big>
<h2 id="beginning">The beginning of creative path</h2>
<br><big>Billy grew up in a creative family: her mom – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Baird">Maggie May Baird</a> is an American actress, voice artist, singer-songwriter and screenwriter; her dad – <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640148/">Patrick O'Connell</a> is an actor, known for Iron Man (2008), The West Wing (1999) and Baskets (2016) and brother –  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finneas_O%27Connell">Finneas Baird O'Connell</a>, known mononymously as Finneas, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, musician, and actor. From childhood, parents noticed that the girl has a craving for music, the desire for which they strongly encouraged. Billy loved music in any form: from simple listening to its physical expression, i.e. dance. Unfortunately, due to multiple injuries, Miss Eilish had to forget about professional dancing. But this did not diminish her love of music.</big>
<br><p><alt><img src="fam.jpg" width="360" height="250">
<br><p><big>Young Billy wrote her first song at age 11. The debut mini-album "Don't Smile at Me" was published in 2017, and included the earliest songs, such as "Ocean Eyes". The first album was released in 2019, entitled "When We All Fall Asleep, Where We Go". One of the biggest projects for musician was her song "No Time To Die" that was devoted to 25th anniversary of Agent 007 films in 2020.</big></p>

              <alt><img src="p0.jpg" width="210" height="210">
              <alt><img src="GBSJ0333.jpg" width="330" height="210"></p>
<br><p><big>By the way, Billy never left her desire for dancing. Yielding inspiration at a concert in St. Petersburg, and later in Madrid in 2019, Miss Eilish had a break in her ligaments right at the concert. Previously, the girl was already warned of a possible outcome. Therefore, she was immediately hospitalized, after which she continued the concert.</big></p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems encountered</h2>
<br><big>Like many people at such a young age, the girl experienced non-reciprocal sympathy, about which she decided to write the song "Wish You Were Gay." It is for this song that the girl will then have to make excuses. As Billy herself later says: “There is nothing in my song that would infringe on the rights of another person or offend his choice. It only describes rather egocentric experiences of a teenager.”</big>
<br><big>The girl’s first studio album is dedicated to a problem that all people face in one way or another: depression, as well as sleepy paralysis. Along with these problems, the girl was faced with the influence of society on the life of pop stars, with condemnation and even aggressive behavior in her direction. One of her comments on this topic was: "Never. Never publish your feelings and emotions. People will take advantage of this." In 2018, she lost one of her best friends, rapper XXXTentacion. Loss played a big role in the work of the girl. In 2019-2020 she clearly opened up about having a depression. She talked about some of anxieties and fears, hoping, that it will help either her fans, or just people who will listen up her words.</big>
<br><big>Billie has a very unique way of thinking. In several interviews she tells about how her songs were created and what is her inspiration for her music and videos. During this interviews she tries to open her perception of the world, herself. She always says that every emotion can be made up in a very creative way, so if you feel something very deeply – let it go in a very specific way – then see what can possibly happen.</big>

<h2 id="shop">Her own merch</h2>
<br><p><big>At the beginning of her career, Billie's style was the so-called “defense”: the girl had a lot of black, chains, spikes. Over time, her clothes began to allow less and less open skin, became freer and baggy. The girl explained her position in this regard by the fact that she wants to avoid objectivization on the part of society regarding adolescents. This is not to say that the girl had any complexes about the figure, but she did not want people to pay attention to how her body was folded, instead of understanding what kind of mindset she had. Having received a certain degree of fame and being understood by the people, the girl began the production of her own line of clothing, accessories and more. </big></p>

<h2 id="features">Features of Billie's songs</h2>
<br><p><big>A feature of Billy’s work, for example, is that she writes almost all of her music in collaboration with her brother, musician Finneas. “My brother is my best friend.” The children grew up together, not parting for a second, in fact, what is still going on. Another distinguishing feature is that Billy turns into music all aspects of her life. An example of this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpx2-EMfdbg">this interview</a>, in which Miss Eilish and her brother will talk about the process of creating one of the most popular songs Bad guy.</big></p>

<h2 id="illness">Turret's syndrome</h2>
<br><big>Tourette’s syndrome is a congenital genetic disease of the nervous system, expressed in systematic motor (motor) and vocal (sound) tics, they cannot be controlled. Vocal tics are the pronunciation of simple sounds (clatter, coughing, choking). They may be accompanied by motor tics, in which various muscle groups are involved. The first symptoms appear in childhood by 4-5 years. The disease is more often diagnosed in boys.
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
  <ul type="square">
   <li>Infections (especially those occurring with fever);</li>
   <li>Intoxication of the body;</li>
   <li>Stress;</li>
   <li>The use of psychotropic substances.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p>
  <ul type="square">
   <li>Symptoms usually peak in adolescence. Then, in most patients, a noticeable improvement occurs. Only 10% of patients have a deterioration after 20 years. In this case, the disease can lead to disability.</li>
   <li>In some cases, seasonality is characteristic of the manifestation of Tourette’s syndrome.</li>
  </ul></big>
<br><big><p>Most of the songs, especially the first tracks, were created in the parental home, the reason for this was that Billy had Turret syndrome, which at one time caused the girl a huge amount of inconvenience. For the first time, she mentions this syndrome in an interview with Hellen, when she asks her to tell the fans why she stopped broadcasting with the help of which the fans could contact her earlier. "The only moment a tick lets me go is when I sing."</big></p>
